Fresh Cart is my first E-commerce project that is built using React.js.
It allows you to create an account, log in to it, and then add your needed & desired products to your cart or save them in your Wishlist for a future purchase.

Features & Tools:
- Authentication & Context
- SPA & Routing using react router
- Online Payment integration using Strip payment gateway
- Form handling & validation using Formik & Yup
- Fetching data from the API using Axios.
- Caching displayed items using React Query for a better UX
- React hooks (useEffect, useState, useParams, useNavigate, useContext)
- Adding not found page.
- using Bootstrap & Fontawsome.

I have built this project for testing & practicing, but I hope I can build a real one with additional features soon Insha`Allah.
